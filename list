AD-BLOCKING DNS SERVERS
These have US-based points of presence and do not log queries, but please double-check before using.
This list is curated by me from https://github.com/curl/curl/wiki/DNS-over-HTTPS primarily for my own use.
DNS-over-HTTPS may be used to enhance the ad-blocking feature in Bromite or Kiwi Browsers and others.

ADGUARD DNS:

DNS-over-HTTPS
Use these strings to set up AdGuard DNS:
For "Default" servers:
https://dns.adguard.com/dns-query

DNS-over-TLS (can be used on Android 9 and higher)
Note: AD-BLOCKING DNS-over-TLS blocks ads on the entire device and may cause some ad-supported apps not to function as expected.
